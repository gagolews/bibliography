    success, preferential attachment) while some others are assigned totally
    at random (all in all, a paper needs a bibliography), we have crafted
    a model that accurately summarizes citation records with merely
    three easily interpretable parameters: productivity, total impact,
    and how lucky an author has been so far.},

    becoming increasingly popular. Tools that evaluate the coverage of unit
    tests, perform static code analysis, or inspect run-time memory use are
    crucial in the software development life cycle. More sophisticated methods
    allow for performing meta-analyses of large software repositories, e.g.,
    to discover abstract topics they relate to or common design patterns applied
    by their developers. They may be useful in gaining a better understanding
    of the component interdependencies, avoiding cloned code as well as
    detecting plagiarism in programming classes. A meaningful measure of
    similarity of computer programs often forms the basis of such tools.
    While there are a few noteworthy instruments for similarity assessment,
    none of them turns out particularly suitable for analysing R code chunks.
    Existing solutions rely on rather simple techniques and heuristics and
    fail to provide a user with the kind of sensitivity and specificity required
    for working with R scripts. In order to fill this gap, we propose a new
    algorithm based on a Program Dependence Graph, implemented in the SimilaR
    package. It can serve as a tool not only for improving R code quality but
    also for detecting plagiarism, even when it has been masked by applying
    some obfuscation techniques or imputing dead code. We demonstrate its
    accuracy and efficiency in a real-world case study.},

        interdependencies between input variables. However, until recently
        the problem of identifying the fuzzy measure values with respect to

        convex functions, we are able to apply DC (difference of convex)
        optimization methods. Here we formulate one of the global optimization
        steps as a local linear programming problem and investigate the
        improvement under different conditions.

        problem arises when we aim to maximize or minimize a convex combination
        of order statistics under linear inequality constraints that act on
        the variables with respect to their original sources. The standalone
        approach to optimizing the OWA under constraints is to consider all
        permutations of the inputs, which becomes quickly infeasible when
        there are more than a few variables, however in certain cases we can
        take advantage of the relationships amongst the constraints and
        the corresponding solution structures. For example, we can consider
        a land-use allocation satisfaction problem with an auxiliary aim of
        balancing land-types, whereby the response curves for each species
        are non-decreasing with respect to the land-types. This results in
        comonotone constraints, which allow us to drastically reduce
        the complexity of the problem.

        In this paper, we show that if we have an arbitrary number of
        constraints that are comonotone (i.e., they share the same ordering
        permutation of the coefficients), then the optimal solution occurs
        for decreasing components of the solution. After investigating the
        form of the solution in some special cases and providing theoretical
        results that shed light on the form of the solution, we detail
        practical approaches to solving and give real-world examples.

        Averaging (OWA) data fusion operator in agglomerative hierarchical

        complete and average linkage schemes. It allows to embody expert
        knowledge in the cluster merge process and to provide a much wider
        range of possible linkages. We analyse various families of weighting
        functions on numerous benchmark data sets in order to assess their
        influence on the resulting cluster structure. Moreover, we inspect
        the correction for the inequality of cluster size distribution --
        similar to the one in the Genie algorithm. Our results demonstrate
        that by robustifying the procedure with the Genie correction,
        we can obtain a significant performance boost in terms of clustering
        quality. This is particularly beneficial in the case of the linkages
        based on the closest distances between clusters, including the single
        linkage and its "smoothed" counterparts. To explain this behaviour,
        we propose a new linkage process called three-stage OWA which yields
        further improvements. This way we confirm the intuition that
        hierarchical cluster analysis should rather take into account
        a few nearest neighbours of each point, instead of trying to adapt
        to their non-local neighbourhood.

        aggregation has been formalized as an order-preserving process that

        computational statistics, data analysis and geometry, usually emphasize
        the role of equivariances to various geometrical transformations in
        aggregation processes. Admittedly, if we consider a unidimensional
        data fusion task, both requirements are often compatible with each
        other. Nevertheless, in this paper we show that, in the
        multidimensional setting, the only idempotent functions that are
        monotone and orthogonal equivariant are the over-simplistic weighted
        centroids. Even more, this result still holds after replacing
        monotonicity and orthogonal equivariance by the weaker property of
        orthomonotonicity. This implies that the aforementioned approaches
        to the aggregation of multidimensional data are irreconcilable,
        and that, if a weighted centroid is to be avoided, we must choose
        between monotonicity and a desirable behaviour with regard to
        orthogonal transformations.
