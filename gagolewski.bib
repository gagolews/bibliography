        for the effective modelling of interactions and dependencies between
        data features or criteria. Its application requires identification
        of the defining capacity (also known as fuzzy measure) values.
        The main limiting factor is the complexity of the underlying parameter
        learning problem, which grows exponentially in the number of variables.
        However, in practice we may have expert knowledge regarding which of
        the subsets of criteria interact with each other, and which groups are
        independent. In this paper we study hierarchical aggregation processes,
        architecturally similar to feed-forward neural networks, but which
        allow for the simplification of the fitting problem both in terms
        of the number of variables and monotonicity constraints. We note that
        the Möbius representation lets us identify a number of relationships
        between the overall fuzzy measure and the data pipeline structure.
        Included in our findings are simplified fuzzy measures that generalise
        both k-intolerant and k-interactive capacities.}

        More precisely, the models can be formulated by maximising the

        The framework proposed, inspired by the prominent Elo rating system,
        yields an iterative version of the ordinal logistic regression
        as well as different variants of the Poisson regression-based models.
        This construction makes the update equations easy to interpret
        as well as adjusts ratings once new match results are observed.
        Thus, it naturally handles temporal changes in team strength.
        Moreover, a study of association football data indicates that the
        new models yield more accurate forecasts and are less computationally demanding than
        corresponding methods that jointly optimise likelihood for the whole set of matches},

    understanding of the component interdependencies, avoiding cloned code
    as well as detecting plagiarism in programming classes. A meaningful
    measure of similarity of computer programs often forms the basis of
    such tools. While there are a few noteworthy instruments for
    similarity assessment, none of them turns out particularly suitable
    for analysing R code chunks. Existing solutions rely on rather
    simple techniques and heuristics and fail to provide a user with
    the kind of sensitivity and specificity required for working with
    R scripts. In order to fill this gap, we propose a new algorithm
    based on a Program Dependence Graph, implemented in the SimilaR package.
    It can serve as a tool not only for improving R code quality but also
    for detecting plagiarism, even when it has been masked by applying some

    abstract = {The constrained ordered weighted averaging (OWA) aggregation
        problem arises when we aim to maximize or minimize a convex combination
        of order statistics under linear inequality constraints that act on
        the variables with respect to their original sources. The standalone
        approach to optimizing the OWA under constraints is to consider all
        permutations of the inputs, which becomes quickly infeasible when
        there are more than a few variables, however in certain cases we can
        take advantage of the relationships amongst the constraints and
        the corresponding solution structures. For example, we can consider
        a land-use allocation satisfaction problem with an auxiliary aim of
        balancing land-types, whereby the response curves for each species
        are non-decreasing with respect to the land-types. This results in
        comonotone constraints, which allow us to drastically reduce
        the complexity of the problem.

        In this paper, we show that if we have an arbitrary number of
        constraints that are comonotone (i.e., they share the same ordering
        permutation of the coefficients), then the optimal solution occurs
        for decreasing components of the solution. After investigating the
        form of the solution in some special cases and providing theoretical
        results that shed light on the form of the solution, we detail
        practical approaches to solving and give real-world examples.

@article{GagolewskiPerezDeBaets2020:inherent,
    abstract = {In the field of information fusion, the problem of data
        aggregation has been formalized as an order-preserving process that
        builds upon the property of monotonicity. However, fields such as
        computational statistics, data analysis and geometry, usually emphasize
        the role of equivariances to various geometrical transformations in
        aggregation processes. Admittedly, if we consider a unidimensional
        data fusion task, both requirements are often compatible with each
        other. Nevertheless, in this paper we show that, in the
        multidimensional setting, the only idempotent functions that are
        monotone and orthogonal equivariant are the over-simplistic weighted
        centroids. Even more, this result still holds after replacing
        monotonicity and orthogonal equivariance by the weaker property of
        orthomonotonicity. This implies that the aforementioned approaches
        to the aggregation of multidimensional data are irreconcilable,
        and that, if a weighted centroid is to be avoided, we must choose
        between monotonicity and a desirable behaviour with regard to
        orthogonal transformations.

Its calculation requires only the lattice minimum and maximum operations, making it particularly suited to ordinal data and robust to scale transformations. However, for practical use in data analysis and prediction, we require efficient methods for learning the associated fuzzy measure. While such methods are well developed for the Choquet integral, the fitting problem is more difficult for the Sugeno integral because it is not amenable to being expressed as a linear combination of weights, and more generally due to plateaus and non-differentiability in the objective function. Previous research has hence focused on heuristic approaches or simplified fuzzy measures. Here we show that the problem of fitting the Sugeno integral to data such that the maximum absolute error is minimized can be solved using an efficient bilevel program. This method can be incorporated into algorithms that learn fuzzy measures with the aim of minimizing the median residual. This equips us with tools that make the Sugeno integral a feasible option in robust data regression and analysis. We provide experimental comparison with a genetic algorithms approach and an example in data analysis.}
