        A special case, the discrete Sugeno integral, defined with respect
        to a nonadditive measure (a capacity), enables accounting for the
        interdependencies between input variables. However, until recently
        the problem of identifying the fuzzy measure values with respect to
        various objectives and requirements has not received a great deal of
        attention. By expressing the learning problem as the difference of
        convex functions, we are able to apply DC (difference of convex)
        optimization methods. Here we formulate one of the global optimization
        steps as a local linear programming problem and investigate the
        improvement under different conditions.

    abstract = {The constrained ordered weighted averaging (OWA) aggregation
        problem arises when we aim to maximize or minimize a convex combination
        of order statistics under linear inequality constraints that act on
        the variables with respect to their original sources. The standalone
        approach to optimizing the OWA under constraints is to consider all
        permutations of the inputs, which becomes quickly infeasible when
        there are more than a few variables, however in certain cases we can
        take advantage of the relationships amongst the constraints and
        the corresponding solution structures. For example, we can consider
        a land-use allocation satisfaction problem with an auxiliary aim of
        balancing land-types, whereby the response curves for each species
        are non-decreasing with respect to the land-types. This results in
        comonotone constraints, which allow us to drastically reduce
        the complexity of the problem.

        In this paper, we show that if we have an arbitrary number of
        constraints that are comonotone (i.e., they share the same ordering
        permutation of the coefficients), then the optimal solution occurs
        for decreasing components of the solution. After investigating the
        form of the solution in some special cases and providing theoretical
        results that shed light on the form of the solution, we detail
        practical approaches to solving and give real-world examples.

        Averaging (OWA) data fusion operator in agglomerative hierarchical
        clustering. The examined setting generalises the well-known single,
        complete and average linkage schemes. It allows to embody expert
        knowledge in the cluster merge process and to provide a much wider
        range of possible linkages. We analyse various families of weighting
        functions on numerous benchmark data sets in order to assess their
        influence on the resulting cluster structure. Moreover, we inspect
        the correction for the inequality of cluster size distribution --
        similar to the one in the Genie algorithm. Our results demonstrate
        that by robustifying the procedure with the Genie correction,
        we can obtain a significant performance boost in terms of clustering
        quality. This is particularly beneficial in the case of the linkages
        based on the closest distances between clusters, including the single
        linkage and its "smoothed" counterparts. To explain this behaviour,
        we propose a new linkage process called three-stage OWA which yields
        further improvements. This way we confirm the intuition that
        hierarchical cluster analysis should rather take into account
        a few nearest neighbours of each point, instead of trying to adapt
        to their non-local neighbourhood.

    abstract = {In the field of information fusion, the problem of data
        aggregation has been formalized as an order-preserving process that
        builds upon the property of monotonicity. However, fields such as
        computational statistics, data analysis and geometry, usually emphasize
        the role of equivariances to various geometrical transformations in
        aggregation processes. Admittedly, if we consider a unidimensional
        data fusion task, both requirements are often compatible with each
        other. Nevertheless, in this paper we show that, in the
        multidimensional setting, the only idempotent functions that are
        monotone and orthogonal equivariant are the over-simplistic weighted
        centroids. Even more, this result still holds after replacing
        monotonicity and orthogonal equivariance by the weaker property of
        orthomonotonicity. This implies that the aforementioned approaches
        to the aggregation of multidimensional data are irreconcilable,
        and that, if a weighted centroid is to be avoided, we must choose
        between monotonicity and a desirable behaviour with regard to
        orthogonal transformations.
